## Description:

A command-line interface mirroring the capabilities of Amazon utilizing the npm inquirer package and MySQL as the back end database, using the npm mysql package.

### Customer Interface

The customer interface allows the user to view available items for sale. The user can then select an item available for sale. If the item is currently in stock then a verification message will appear and the application exits. If the desired item or the quantity desired is not available, an alert will tell the customer and prompt for another item.
